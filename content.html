<p>In Python, many built-in types support concatenation using the <code>+</code> operator. Some common types include strings, lists, tuples, and dictionaries. Here, we will use strings and lists as examples.</p>

<p></p>In Python, you can concatenate several objects in a single expression, and the result will be a new collection of the same type. You can use a mixture of literals and variables in concatenation expressions.</p>

<py-cell>string1 = "Hello"
string2 = "World"
combined = string1 + " " + string2 // Can concatenate multiple strings including literals
print(combined)</py-cell>

When concatenating, the original objects remain unchanged, and a new object is created to hold the result.

<py-cell>list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [4, 5, 6]

combined_list = list1 + list2
print(combined_list)
print(list1)
print(list2)</label></py-cell>

<h2>Concatenating Different Types</h2>

<p>Attempting to concatenate different types (e.g., a string and a list) will raise a <code class="language-python">TypeError</code>. For example:</p>

<py-cell>result = [1, 2, 3] + "hello"
</py-cell>
